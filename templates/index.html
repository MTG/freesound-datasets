  <h1 class="ui header">Welcome to the Freesound Datasets platform</h1>
  <p>
    The goal of Freesound Datasets is to have a website to host and create datasets based on
    Freesound content. The website should allow collaborative creation of public datasets and
    should provide a way for researchers to explore the dataset and to download it. By “exploring
    the dataset” we mean something like Google <a href="https://research.google.com/audioset/">AudioSet’s site.</a>
    Although the project should be generic enough to support several datasets, the most important
    dataset is called FreesoundDataset. <br> <br>
    You can find more information in our <a href="">ISMIR 2017 paper</a>.

  <h3 class="ui header"> FreesoundDataset </h3>
  <p>
    FreesoundDataset is basically a classification of <a href="http://freesound.org/">Freesound</a> content into the
    <a href="https://github.com/audioset/ontology">ontology</a> that Google use in AudioSet.
