  <h1 class="ui header">Welcome to the Freesound Datasets platform!</h1>
  <p>
    Freesound Datasets is a platform for the collaborative creation of open audio datasets based on
    Freesound content.
    We believe that datasets can have a greater impact if they are created and maintained according to some principles.
    In our view, datasets should be <b>transparent</b> in their creation process, should be released under
    <b>open licenses</b> to allow their free distribution, and should be <b>dynamic</b> in the sense that they can evolve
    over time in quality and quantity. Freesound Datasets facilitates the creation and maintenance of audio datasets which
    are built with these principles in mind.
  </p>

  <h3 class="ui header">How?</h3>
  <p>
    We rely on the community to make this project sustainable. We leverage
    <a target="_blank" href="http://freesound.org/">Freesound.org</a> as source of <b>open audio content</b>
    for the creation of datasets. We plan to gather sound annotations through <b>crowdsourcing</b> using
    Freesound Datasets in order to construct ground truth for the datasets.
  </p>

  <h3 class="ui header">What can be done in this platform?</h3>
  <p>
    You can <b>explore</b> the content of the hosted datasets and you can also <b>download</b> them.
    But even more importantly, you can contribute to their creation in different ways.
    Currently, you can annotate sound in order to generate ground truth and you can <b>discuss</b> the datasets as well
    as the platform. In the future we plan to enable more functionalities, such as the <b>reporting</b> of mislabeled
    or faulty audio samples.

  <p>
    We plan to host several open audio datasets built out of Freesound content. The first and most important dataset
    is called FreesoundDataset (FSD).
