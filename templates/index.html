    The goal of Freesound Datasets is to have a website to host and create datasets based on
    Freesound content. The website should allow collaborative creation of public datasets and
    should provide a way for researchers to explore the dataset and to download it. By “exploring
    the dataset” we mean something like Google AudioSet’s site: https://research.google.com/audioset/.
    Although the project should be generic enough to support several datasets, the most important
    dataset will be called FreesoundDataset, and will be basically a classification of Freesound
    content into the “ontology” that Google use in AudioSet (https://github.com/audioset/ontology,
    also see paper: https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/45857.pdf).
    Therefore, the priority now should be to make the site work for the FreesoundDataset case.
    As a suggestion, Freesound Datasets could be accessed at datasets.freesound.org.
