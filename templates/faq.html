  <h2 class="ui header">Who maintains this platform?</h2>
  <p>
      This platform is brought to you from the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.upf.edu/web/mtg">
      Music Technology Group</a> in the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.upf.edu/">Universitat Pompeu Fabra</a>.
      The main researchers behind this platform are: <br>
      Xavier Favory <br>
      Andres Ferraro <br>
      Eduardo Fonseca <br>
      Frederic Font <br>
      Jordi Pons <br>
      Alastair Porter <br>
      Xavier Serra (Head of the Music Technology Group) <br>

  <h2 class="ui header">Why should I contribute by annotating sounds?</h2>
  <p>
      For you, it might be just a little while. However, by crowdsourcing annotations from a lot of people worldwide
      we aim to build well-curated datasets that can foster research in multiple fields. In particular, our first
      dataset (FSD) can be used for research on acoustic event recognition for example. By annotating sounds for FSD,
      you would be helping to improve a variety of tasks ranging from speech recognition to healthcare applications.
      In the context of multimedia hosting sites it could allow semantically assisted annotation or automatic
      description of multimedia. Other applications include bioacoustics monitoring, identification of noise sources,
      or acoustic surveillance. You know, one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankindâ€¦

  <h2 class="ui header">I have a suggestion/idea about the platform or a dataset...</h2>
  <p>
      Great! We are happy to hear it. Please visit our <a target="_blank" href="">Discussion</a> page and join other
      users in the discussion hosted in <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/MTG/freesound-datasets/issues">
      GitHub</a>. You can also contact us by <a target="_top" href="mailto:mtg@upf.edu">mail</a> if you prefer.
      Any input is more than welcome!
  </p>

  <h2 class="ui header">Do you provide a reward in exchange for annotation effort?</h2>
  <p>
      We do not provide any reward in exchange for contributions. For the time being, we trust that sound enthusiasts
      and people interested in sound and music computing from different communities (like the
      <a target="_blank" href="https://freesound.org/">Freesound</a> community) will want to participate without
      expecting anything in return. By doing this, you will be contributing to the curation of datasets that will have
      a positive social impact in multiple areas. On the other hand, we expect that users that benefit from the
      platform (by downloading, exploring or using the datasets) will want to contribute as well.
  </p>

  <h2 class="ui header">Is the Freesound Datasets platform hosting third-party datasets on demand?</h2>
  <p>
      Currently we do not provide the service of hosting any external dataset on demand. We might consider doing it in
      the future.
  </p>

  <h2 class="ui header">How are new datasets added to the platform?</h2>
  <p>
      Currently only the administrators of Freesound Datasets can add new datasets to the platform.
      Do you have a dataset(based on Freesound content) that you'd like to host here? Feel free to contact us at
      <a target="_top" href="mailto:mtg@upf.edu">mtg@upf.edu</a>.
