    Why should I contribute by annotating sounds?
  </div>
  <div class="content">
    <p style="display: block ! important;" class="transition visible">For you it might be just a little while &mdash; 
      however, via crowdsourcing annotations from a lot of people worldwide
      we aim to build well-curated datasets that can foster research in multiple fields. In particular, our first
      dataset (FSD) can be used for research on acoustic event recognition for example. By annotating sounds for FSD,
      you would be helping to improve a variety of tasks ranging from speech recognition to healthcare applications.
      Other applications include bioacoustics monitoring, identification of noise sources,
      or acoustic surveillance. You know, one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind!</p>

    Is the Freesound Datasets platform hosting third-party datasets on demand?
  </div>
  <div class="content">
    <p>Currently we do not provide the service of hosting any external dataset on demand. We might consider doing it in
      the future.</p>

   How are new datasets added to the platform?
  </div>
  <div class="content">
    <p>Currently only the administrators of Freesound Datasets can add new datasets to the platform. Do you have a
      dataset (based on Freesound content) that you'd like to add here? Do you have a dataset which is not based on
      Freesound, but whose content fits in the context of Freesound? Feel free to contact us at
      <a target="_top" href="mailto:mtg@upf.edu">mtg@upf.edu</a>.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>Great, we are happy to hear it! Please visit our <a target="_blank" href="{% url 'discussion' %}">Discussion</a>
      page and join other users in the discussion hosted in <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/MTG/freesound-datasets/issues">

    Do you provide a reward in exchange for annotation effort?
  </div>
  <div class="content">
    <p> We do not provide any reward in exchange for contributions. For the time being, we trust that sound enthusiasts
      and people interested in sound and music computing from different communities (like the
      <a target="_blank" href="https://freesound.org/">Freesound</a> community) will want to participate without
      expecting anything in return. By doing this, you will be contributing to the curation of datasets that will have
      a positive social impact in multiple areas. On the other hand, we expect that users that benefit from the
      platform (by downloading, exploring or using the datasets) will want to contribute as well.</p>
