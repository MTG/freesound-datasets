    <p>
        Thank you for participating in the Tagathon’s first edition! <b>Please read these guidelines carefully</b> before annotating.
        If you have any questions, do not hesitate to ask an organizer.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>A bit of context:</b> As you may know, we are trying to build a dataset with sounds from Freesound following
        the <a href="https://research.google.com/audioset/ontology/index.html" target="_blank">AudioSet Ontology</a>.
        As starting point, we have populated the AudioSet sound categories with Freesound clips based on tag matching
        (manually assigning Freesound tags to each category).
    </p>

    <h3>Why are we doing this Tagathon?</h3>
    <p>
        The <b>main goal</b> is to validate annotations obtained from the tag matching process, which will allow us to:
        <ul class="ui list" style="margin-top:-20px;margin-left:40px;font-weight: 100;">
            <li>Estimate the quality of the sound categories coming from that process</li>
            <li>Take the first step towards building a Freesound Dataset</li>
            <li>Gather feedback on the ontology, the audio content and the annotation procedure</li>
            <li>Test the annotation tool and think of improvements</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Tagathon guidelines</h3>
    <p>
        To organize the Tagathon, we have split the sound categories of the
        <a href="https://research.google.com/audioset/ontology/index.html" target="_blank">AudioSet Ontology</a> into
        several groups that can be seen in this <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JfKJCyCf1vKcrIUk0dHzKEt56dMTLwLnm3SHTzhDSXI/edit?usp=sharing"
        target="_blank">spreadsheet</a> (surrounded by red boxes). Categories in each group should be validated by one person.
        These groups vary in size, so that you can choose one based on how much time you think that you have available to help.
        For each category you will be presented with pages of 12 sounds. <b>For each sound clip, you will be asked if this
        sound contains the item described by the category</b>. You will find more detailed description below, in the section
        <a onclick="$(document.body).scrollTop($('#how-to-validate-a-category').offset().top - 70);" href="javascript:void(0);">How to validate a category</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        You <b><u>should</u> validate until the number of validated annotations reaches 72</b>. You can see this number in the table at the top of a validation page, after choosing a category.
        Some categories may contain fewer sounds (&lt; 72). In this case, just validate all annotations (the interface will tell you whenever it is the case).
    </p>

                            Note that in some cases there may be several paths, ie, several parents for your category. For example, <a href="https://datasets.freesound.org/fsd/explore/%252Fm%252F07rjwbb/" target="_blank">Hiss</a>:
                            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Animal > Domestic animals, pets > Cat > Hiss</i>
                            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Animal > Wild animals > Snake > Hiss</i>
