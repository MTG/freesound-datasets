  <h1 class="ui header">Discussion</h1>
  <p>
      One way of contributing is through discussing the hosted datasets and the platform itself.
      We would like the community to get involved and to share comments and suggestions with us and with other users.
      The goal is to create discussion around different issues so that they can be addressed with contributions from
      the community.
  </p>

  <p>
      Currently, the discussions are hosted in the platformâ€™s
      <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/MTG/freesound-datasets/issues">GitHub</a> repository since it provides
      all the necessary tools to have focused discussions. In Github, issues can be created and labeled to organize the
      discussion in topics. Also functionalities to track their evolution are provided. You can also participate in
      discussions by subscribing to our Google Group <a target="_blank" href="">FreesoundDatasets</a>.
      Or if you prefer, you can contact us via <a target="_top" href="mailto:mtg@upf.edu">mail</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
      There are several aspects that can be the subject of discussion. We encourage discussion around the <b>datasets</b>
      with the purpose of gaining insight and identifying potential improvements. The discussion will ideally be focused
      not only on the dataset content (for example by detecting errors like mislabeled or faulty audio samples), but
      also on the workflow of the data collection process (for example the definition and implementation of annotation
      tasks and their guidelines). We are also interested in discussion about the ground truth taxonomies of datasets.
      On the other hand, we welcome inputs about improvements of the <b>Freesound Datasets platform</b> and proposals
      about new platform functionalities and datasets.
