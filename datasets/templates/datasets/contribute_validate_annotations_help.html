        This task consists of validating the presence of an acoustic event in audio files.

                        First you will have to <b>choose a category</b> of acoustic event from the AudioSet Ontology.
                        Please choose a category of sound you feel familiar with.
                        Three tables are available in order to provide you different ways for selecting your category:

                    <p><b>Familiarise yourself with your category and its related categories</b>.
                        The section at the top of the page gives you an overview of the category and its meaning:
                        hierarchy (siblings and direct children) in the ontology, definition, examples and
                        frequently asked questions. Click on a category name to display some more information.</p>
                </span>
                <p><b>If you don't feel comfortable</b> with the category you are in, please <b>consider changing</b>
